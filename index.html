<p style="text-align:left"><em>Hey fellow readers, welcome to my personal page.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>As you may have gathered thus far, my name is Xihang.</p>

<p>I am currently a researcher in Health Data Science at <a href="https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/xihang-chen">NDORMS</a>, University of Oxford. I commonly work with OMOP CDM (Common Data Model) to design and test analytical pipeline using R to answer reserach questions using RWE (Real World Evidence).</p>

<p>Prior to joining, I did my Integrated Masters in Mathematics at University of Oxford, more specifically St Peter&#39;s College. My final year dissertation was on Algebraic Number Theory, titled&nbsp;<em>Chabauty Techniques in Number Theory.</em></p>
